## The purpose of this site

This is intended for me to organize my findings of things that I'm interested in.  
A collection of resources from individual security and privacy researchers.
If it helps someone else locally (or elseware) to better understand tech, security and privacy, then great.
However, this is more so for myself to have quick access to facts and how things actually work in the field I'm aspiring a profession in.  
  
**rough draft write up**  

Also my own howtos/guides for me to reuse and improve on my setup.
As well navigation and support resources for local / provincial people effected by mental health and raise more awareness.
